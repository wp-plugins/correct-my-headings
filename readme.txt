=== Correct My Headings ===
Contributors: nonsalant
Tags: seo, headings, subheadings, content, title, post, posts, page, pages, archive, excerpt, theme, h1, h2
Requires at least: 2.7
Tested up to: 3.3.1
Stable tag: "trunk"

Turns subheadings down a notch on archive pages: H2's become H3's, H3's become H4's, ..., H6's become paragraphs.

== Description ==

If your subheadings appear on archive pages, they need to start from H3 (because H2 tags are used by the post titles on archive pages).

This plugin dynamically corrects subheadings before they are displayed on your site -- for SEO and semantic markup purposes.

You will be able to select one of the following two options (the first one being the default):

* My subheadings start from the H2 level: **turn them down** a level on archive pages.
*H2's become H3's, H3's become H4's, H4's become H5's, H5's become H6's and H6's become paragraphs *

* My subheadings start from the H3 level: **turn them up** a level on single posts or pages.
*H3's become H2's, H4's become H3's, H5's become H6's and H6's become H5's *


**This plugin does not make any changes to your database**: the subheadings will **only be displayed differently** on the front-end site. 
If you disable the plugin or decide to uninstall it everything will be back to normal.
